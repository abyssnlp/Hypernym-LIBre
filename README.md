Description
-----------
Detecting hierarchial relationships between terms in text is a key area of research in the field of knowledge representation and NLP. In our paper, describe a new web-based corpus for extracting hypernyms and compare it with a corpus used for the current state-of-the-art but is not freely available.  
The corpus is a combination of the [UMBC Corpus](https://ebiquity.umbc.edu/blogger/2013/05/01/umbc-webbase-corpus-of-3b-english-words/) and [Wikipedia](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/). We apply our own pre-processing and post-processing methodologies for extracting hypernym-hyponym pairs from the text using [Hearst Patterns](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.3115/992133.992154) (Marti Hearst, 1992). 

Location

The corpus is provided in two formats. One is the raw text format and the other is its part-of-speech tagged and dependency parsed version.
